        <h1>AWS Cloud Security</h1>
        <p>
            Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer.
            This shared model can help relieve the customerâ€™s operational burden as AWS operates,
            manages and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization
            layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the service operates.
            The customer assumes responsibility and management of the guest operating system
            (including updates and security patches), other associated application software as well
            as the configuration of the AWS provided security group firewall.
        </p>
            
            <h4>Infrastructure protection</h4>
            <p>AWS protects web applications by filtering traffic based on rules that you create. For example,
            you can filter web requests based on IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body,
            or URI strings, which allows you to block common attack patterns,
     
            <h4>Threat detection & continuous monitoring</h4>
            <p>AWS identifies threats by continuously monitoring the network activity and account behavior within your
                cloud environment.</p>

            <h4>Compliance & data privacy</h4>
            <p>AWS gives you a comprehensive view of your compliance status and continuously monitors your
            environment using automated compliance checks based on the AWS best practices and industry standards your
                organization follows.</p>

        <h4>AWS WAF - Web Application Firewall</h4>
        <p>AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web
        exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
        AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to
        create security rules that block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site
        scripting, and rules that filter out specific traffic patterns you define.
        You can get started quickly using Managed Rules for AWS WAF, a pre-configured set of rules managed
        by AWS or AWS Marketplace Sellers. The Managed Rules for WAF address issues like the OWASP
        Top 10 security risks. These rules are regularly updated as new issues emerge. AWS WAF includes a
        full-featured API that you can use to automate the creation, deployment, and maintenance of
            security rules.</p>

    <h4>
        AWS Guard Duty
    </h4>
    <p>
        GuardDuty identifies threats by continuously monitoring the network activity and account behavior within the AWS
        environment. Amazon GuardDuty comes integrated with up-to-date threat intelligence feeds from AWS, CrowdStrike,
        and Proofpoint. Threat intelligence coupled with machine learning and behavior models help you detect activity
        such as crypto-currency mining, credential compromise behavior, communication with known command-and-control
        servers, or API calls from known malicious IPs
    </p>
  
    <h4>
        AWS Security Groups
    </h4>
    <p>
        AWS security groups  are associated with EC2 instances and provide security at the protocol and port access
        level. Security Groups may be thought of as a stateful ACL or layer 4 firewall and contains a set of rules that
        filter traffic into and out of an EC2 instance.
    </p>
   
<h4>
    AWS Nat Gateways
</h4>
    <p>
       You can use a network address translation (NAT) gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to
        the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.
